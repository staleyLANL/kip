This directory contains the source files that comprise the Kip library.

Include kip.h in your own code. It includes the other files, in their proper
order. Be sure that this directory is known to the compiler when you compile
your code. On many compilers, this is done with the -I option.

Kip is a "header-only" library. Therefore, these files are all that you need
in order to use every feature Kip provides.
